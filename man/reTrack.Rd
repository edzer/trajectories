\title{
Reconstruct objects of class "Track"
}
\description{
Function reTrack accepts X as an object of class "Track". Output is a reconstructed Track (again an object of class Track), based on a regular "timestamp". It only returns the interpolated points.
}
\usage{
reTrack(X,at=c("track","dfrm"),timestamp=timestamp,tsq=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
an object of class Track
}
\item{at}{
to set the type of output as either an object of class "Track" or data.frame
}
\item{timestamp}{
timestamp which Track be reconstructed based on
}
\item{tsq}{
a time sequence to reconstruct Track X based on it. This is optional. If this is not given, the function creates the time sequance based on timestamp.
}
}
\details{
Sometimes tracks data are not collected according to a regular timestamp. In order to compare different tracks which share some time intervals, we might need to be aware of the locations in a regular timestamp. Function reTrack unables us to reconstruct an object of class "Track" based on a regular timestamp. Time sequance can be given by user, if not reTrack creates a regulare time sequance based on the given timestamp. 
}
\value{
Either an object of class "Track" or a data.frame
}

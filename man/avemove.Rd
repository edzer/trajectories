\title{
Average movement of trajectory pattern
}
\description{
This returns the average movements of a lits of objects of class "Track" over time.
}
\usage{
avemove(X,timestamp,epsilon=epsilon)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{a list of some objects of class Track
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
\item{timestamp}{timestamp to calculate the pairwise distances between tarcks}
\item{epsilon}{(optional) movements with length less than epsilon are not considered in the calculation}
}
\details{
when analysying a list of tracks, avemove calculate the average of movements based on given timestamp.}
\value{
an object of class "numeric" or "arwlen".
